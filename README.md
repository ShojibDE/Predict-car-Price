# Predict-car-Price
A basic model using Linear Regression to predict car price

# Overview
Made this model with different combination of knowledge.here we try to see model
performance if I drop corrupted rows without replacing them with statistical measure.
Also try to reveal, if data volume is low, with which technique I can improve it .
Although , a simple LinearRegression is not used  real life generally with regulariztion(Ridge or
Lasso). I made it to my study purpose .
